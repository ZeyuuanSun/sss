		<h2>Seg way'n USA</h2>
		<p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>
		<h2>June2,2012</h2>
		<img src="journal/images/segway1.jpg">
		<p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe  I finally got everything packed and reddy to go. Because I'm on a Seyway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> cell phone,</li>
			<li>ipod, </li>
			<li>digital camera,</li>
			<li>and a protein bar.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,<q>A journey of a athousand miles begins with one step Segway.</q></p>
		<h2>July 14,2012</h2>
		<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
		<blockquote>
		passing cars,<br>
		when you can't see,<br>
		May get you,<br>
		 A glimpse .<br>
		Of eternity.<br>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Idefinitely won't be passing any car.</p>
